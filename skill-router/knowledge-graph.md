# Knowledge graph

A pre-built weighted graph of skills, agents, MCP servers, and cataloged
harnesses in the ctx ecosystem, shipped as `graph/wiki-graph.tar.gz`.
The on-disk JSON and `resolve_graph` Python API are harness-aware, including
plain-slug graph walks from `harness:<slug>` nodes. `ctx-monitor`
exposes skill/agent/MCP/harness wiki and graph views; harness install,
update, load/unload, and quality scoring remain CLI/API workflows.

## What's in it

Authoritative numbers from the shipped tarball. The curated-core snapshot
is **13,232 nodes** (1,969 curated skills + 464 agents + 10,786 MCP servers
+ 13 harnesses). Harness pages under `entities/harnesses/` are ingested into
local rebuilds and the separate harness-catalog recommendation path. The
tarball also carries **90,846 remote-cataloged Skills.sh `skill` nodes**,
matching skill pages under `entities/skills/skills-sh-*.md`. **89,461**
hydrated Skills.sh bodies are shipped as micro-skill orchestrators under
`converted/skills-sh-*/SKILL.md`; **28,611** long originals are preserved as
`SKILL.md.original` and used for full-body semantic graphing.

## Install

Extract the tarball into your `~/.claude/skill-wiki/` to get a
ready-to-query graph plus every shipped skill/agent/MCP entity page,
cataloged harness pages when present, remote-cataloged Skills.sh skill
pages, concept pages, and converted micro-skill pipelines. The extracted
tree also includes the Skills.sh catalog JSON used by the shared
recommender:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skill-wiki
tar xzf graph/wiki-graph.tar.gz -C ~/.claude/skill-wiki/
```

The extracted tree also opens directly as an Obsidian vault — the
`.obsidian/` config ships inside the tarball — so you can use
Obsidian's native graph view if you prefer it to the web dashboard.

## How edges are built

Three sources of connectivity, combined at build time by the
`ctx-wiki-graphify` console script (`ctx.core.wiki.wiki_graphify`):

1. **Semantic cosine** — when the embedding backend is available, entity
   text is embedded and semantic neighbors above the configured build floor
   contribute weighted edges.
2. **Explicit frontmatter tags** — each entity page's YAML `tags:`
   list contributes edges between every pair of entities that share
   a tag. Popular tags capped at 500 nodes to avoid noise-floor
   "everything connects to everything" mega-buckets like `typescript`
   or `frontend`.
3. **Slug-token pseudo-tags** — each hyphenated slug contributes its
   tokens as implicit tags. `fastapi-pro` contributes `fastapi`;
   `python-patterns` contributes `python` and `patterns`. A stop-word
   filter drops generic tokens like `skill`, `agent`, `pro`, `expert`,
   `core` so they don't over-connect the graph.

Edge `weight` is the final blended strength after semantic, tag, and token
signals are combined. Edge metadata keeps the ingredients explainable:
`semantic_sim` for cosine similarity, `shared_tags` for explicit tags, and
`shared_tokens` for slug-token overlap. Hydrated Skills.sh records use their
preserved `SKILL.md.original` bodies for semantic graphing, so the graph
keeps full-body similarity even though the installable `SKILL.md` files are
short micro-skill orchestrators.

## Communities

After edges are built, `wiki_graphify` runs NetworkX's Louvain
community detection (`resolution=1.2`, `seed=42` for determinism).
The result is **53 communities** ranging from single-member isolated
specialists to several thousand members in broad clusters like
`Community + Official + AI`. Each community also gets an auto-generated
`concepts/<community>.md` wiki page summarizing its members and top
shared tags.

The legacy CNM ("greedy modularity") algorithm is still available
behind `CTX_GRAPH_COMMUNITY=cnm` — it's deterministic but O(n²) on
dense graphs and hangs on the live 13K-node dataset (~50min run was
killed on 2026-04-27 inside the priority-queue siftup). Louvain is
the default because it finishes in seconds and produces equivalent
quality clusters for the recommendation use case.

## Querying the graph

### Via the dashboard

```bash
ctx-monitor serve              # http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

Then open `/graph?slug=<entity-slug>&type=<entity-type>` for a
cytoscape neighborhood view, or
`/api/graph/<slug>.json?type=<entity-type>&hops=1&limit=40` for the
dashboard-shaped JSON. The `type` query is optional for unique slugs and
recommended for duplicate slugs such as `langgraph`. See the
[dashboard reference](dashboard.md) for the full route catalogue.

### Via Python

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path
from networkx.readwrite import node_link_graph

raw = json.loads(
    Path("~/.claude/skill-wiki/graphify-out/graph.json").expanduser().read_text()
)
edges_key = "links" if "links" in raw else "edges"
G = node_link_graph(raw, edges=edges_key)

# 104,078 nodes, 2,960,189 edges
print(G.number_of_nodes(), G.number_of_edges())

# Find entities related to 'fastapi-pro' by edge weight
seed = "skill:fastapi-pro"
neighbors = sorted(
    G.neighbors(seed),
    key=lambda n: G[seed][n]["weight"],
    reverse=True,
)[:10]
for n in neighbors:
    shared = G[seed][n].get("shared_tags", [])
    print(f"  w={G[seed][n]['weight']:>2}  {G.nodes[n]['label']:<40}  {shared[:3]}")
```

The node-link JSON schema's edges key is auto-detected (legacy
NetworkX 2.x used `"links"`; current versions default to `"edges"`).
The helper `resolve_graph.load_graph()` does this for you.

### Via recommendation paths

The graph backs two recommendation paths:

- Execution recommendation surfaces (`ctx.recommend_bundle`, MCP
  `ctx__recommend_bundle`, generic harness tools, Claude Code hook
  suggestions, and repo-scan advisory output) share
  `ctx.core.resolve.recommendations.recommend_by_tags` for skills,
  agents, and MCP servers. That engine ranks candidates by
  slug-token matches, tag overlap, graph degree, and semantic-cache
  signals when available. Skills.sh results are `skill` nodes with
  `source_catalog=skills.sh`, `detail_url`, `install_command`, duplicate
  hints, micro-skill orchestrators when hydrated, and quality/security
  metadata. If an older
  extracted wiki has the Skills.sh catalog JSON but no graph nodes for
  those records, the same recommender falls back to the catalog file.
- Harness recommendations are a separate catalog path for custom/API/local
  model onboarding (`ctx-init --model-mode custom ...`) and
  `ctx-harness-install`. They use the same graph catalog filtered to
  `harness` nodes and the higher harness match floor from `config.json`.
- Repository scans still start from stack detections and installed-entity
  availability. `resolve_skills.resolve()` maps detected languages,
  frameworks, infrastructure, and tools through the shared stack matrix, then
  uses the graph as an advisory augmentation source for additional installed
  skills, agents, and MCP server suggestions. Harnesses are intentionally not
  emitted from repo scans or Claude Code hook bundles.

This split is intentional: execution surfaces need identical ranking and a
small top-K, while harness choice changes the model runtime itself and belongs
in an explicit onboarding/install flow.

### LLM-wiki design references

ctx follows Karpathy's LLM-wiki pattern. We also reviewed
[`nashsu/llm_wiki`](https://github.com/nashsu/llm_wiki) as a design reference
for source traceability, persistent ingest queues, graph insights, and
budgeted token/vector/graph retrieval. That repository is GPLv3, while ctx is
MIT, so ctx can use those ideas as product inspiration but must not copy or
vendor its code or assets.

## Rebuilding

After you add a skill, agent, MCP server, or harness entity page:

```bash
ctx-wiki-graphify          # rebuild entity graph + communities
```

The pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) re-runs this
automatically when `skills/` or `agents/` are staged, and repacks
the tarball on disk so `README.md` numbers never drift. Run
`ctx-wiki-graphify` directly for MCP server or harness catalog changes
if your hook config does not include those paths.

## Edge-count history

| Version | Edges | Note |
|---|---|---|
| v0.5.x | 642K (stale) / 861 (live) | Bundle had stale 642K; live rebuild silently produced 861 because `DENSE_TAG_THRESHOLD=20` dropped every popular tag. |
| v0.6.0 | 454,719 | Threshold raised to 500, multi-line YAML lists parsed, slug-token pseudo-tags added. |
| v0.7.x | 847,207 | Pulsemcp ingest added 10,786 MCP server nodes; sentence-embedding semantic edges added. |
| 2026-04-27 (this release) | **963,068** | +21 mattpocock skills, +156 designdotmd designs (+106,702 edges); patch-path bug fixed (graphify now forces full rebuild when prior graph has 0 semantic edges but current run computed semantic pairs); community detection switched from CNM to Louvain. |
| 2026-04-29 Skills.sh remote-cataloged pass | **1,030,831** | +90,846 first-class `skill` nodes, +90,846 skill pages, and +67,519 sparse duplicate/tag metadata edges to the curated graph. Full-body semantic edges are intentionally deferred to the hydration pass. |
| 2026-04-29 text-to-cad harness pass | **1,031,011** | +1 first-class `harness` node, +1 harness page, and +224 explainable harness edges, including 44 remote-cataloged Skills.sh edges. |
| 2026-04-29 curated harness catalog pass | **1,033,253** | +12 first-class `harness` nodes/pages for LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, Google ADK, Semantic Kernel, Mastra, Pydantic AI, Haystack, OpenAI Agents SDK, LiteLLM, Langfuse, and AgentOps; harness incident edges now total 2,700. |
| 2026-04-30 Skills.sh semantic hydration pass | **2,881,027** | +full-body semantic edges for hydrated Skills.sh records; semantic top-K became the dominant large-scale signal. |
| 2026-05-01 Skills.sh micro-skill pass | **2,960,189** | Converted all 89,461 hydrated Skills.sh `SKILL.md` files to <=180-line orchestrators, preserved 28,611 originals for semantic graphing, bounded generated stage/reference files to 40 lines, and rebuilt the graph. |

The full audit history lives in `CHANGELOG.md`. The current build is
fully reproducible from the wiki content.

## Pre-ship gates

Two advisory gates run before the tarball is repackaged. Both produce
review reports and never auto-modify the catalog.

- **`ctx-dedup-check`** — flags entity pairs (skill ↔ skill, skill ↔
  agent, skill ↔ MCP, agent ↔ agent, agent ↔ MCP, MCP ↔ MCP) at or
  above 0.85 cosine similarity. Incremental: keeps a `dedup-state.json`
  next to the embedding cache, so follow-up runs only re-check pairs
  involving entities whose content changed. Allowlist support via
  `.dedup-allowlist.txt`. The current snapshot has 15,976 findings,
  most of which are within-MCP near-duplicates (multiple wrappers
  around the same upstream service).
- **`ctx-tag-backfill`** — finds skills/agents with empty `tags:`
  frontmatter and proposes a backfill drawn from slug tokens, body
  keywords, and the existing tag vocabulary. Report-only by default;
  pass `--apply` to write. Backfills are additive only.
